## backwards design

Set goals for educational curriculum before choosing instructional methods + forms of assessment

1. Identify desired results
1. Determine acceptable evidence
1. Plan learning experiences and instruction

## 2016 Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE)

1. Teach statistical thinking.  
  - Teach statistics as an investigative process of problem-solving and decision making.
  - Give students experience with multivariable thinking [...] to answer challenging questions that require them to investigate and explore relationships among many variables.
1. Focus on conceptual understanding. 
1. Integrate real data with a context and purpose.
1. Foster active learning.
1. Use technology to explore concepts and analyse data.
1. Use assessments to improve and evaluate student learning.

.discussion[
Discuss in groups of three and then as a large group.

- What are your first reactions to the curriculum we just described for an intro data science course? 
- Which components can you see yourself (or do you already) include in an intro data science curriculum?
- Which components do you have reservations about, and why?
