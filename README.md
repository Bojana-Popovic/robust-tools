# Robust Tools for Psychological Science

Hi\!

If you’re coming here from the honours course materials… gosh this page
looks unpleasant, right? I’m writing a friendlier and more helpful
website at the moment. It has more information but without all the weird
GitHub stuff\!

*Course summary:* The research toolkit in psychological science has
changed a lot in the last decade. Across many areas there is a
heightened emphasis on transparency, open access, and a preference for
the use of freely available tools. These skills are rarely taught during
undergraduate psychology classes, and because research methods classes
tend to be statistics heavy, they’re rarely a part of research
methodology classes either. This elective provides a hands on tutorial
in how to use these tools: it covers an introduction to R programming,
modern data visualisation and data wrangling, how to structure your
projects, proper version control with git and GitHub, how to use OSF and
PsyArXiv, and even how to write APA manuscripts from within R and set up
a professional website to promote your work\! The course is designed for
novices, and no preexisting familiarity with these tools and no
programming background is assumed.
