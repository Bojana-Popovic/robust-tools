# Robust Tools for Psychological Science

The research toolkit in psychological science has changed a lot in the last decade. Across many areas there is a heightened emphasis on transparency, open access, and a preference for the use of freely available tools. These skills are rarely taught during undergraduate psychology classes, and because research methods classes tend to be statistics heavy, they're rarely a part of research methodology classes either. This elective provides a hands on tutorial in how to use these tools: it covers an introduction to R programming, modern data visualisation and data wrangling, how to structure your projects, proper version control with git and GitHub, how to use OSF and PsyArXiv, and even how to write APA manuscripts from within R and set up a professional website to promote your work! The course is designed for novices, and no preexisting familiarity with these tools and no programming background is assumed. See https://github.com/djnavarro/robust-tools for details. 

**Notes on assessment:**

I'm on my way back from a conference and so won't be able to post a comprehensive description of the assessment until I get back, but a couple of people have asked so here's the gist...

The assessment will have two components: one part will be made up of a series of (very brief) quizzes on each section of the course (shouldn't be more than 10 minutes of work each week), and the other part will be a project of *your* choosing that uses the skills you've learned during the class (which can be written work, programming, whatever... each student will be able to discuss their projects with me). The final week of the class will consist of each student giving a brief presentation (~10-15 minutes) on what their project was about, and that presentation would count as part of the project for assessment purposes.
