# Robust Tools for Psychological Science

The research toolkit in psychological science has changed a lot in the last decade. Across many areas there is a heightened emphasis on transparency, open access, and a preference for the use of freely available tools. These skills are rarely taught during undergraduate psychology classes, and because research methods classes tend to be statistics heavy, they're rarely a part of research methodology classes either. This elective provides a hands on tutorial in how to use these tools: it covers an introduction to R programming, modern data visualisation and data wrangling, how to structure your projects, proper version control with git and GitHub, how to use OSF and PsyArXiv, and even how to write APA manuscripts from within R and set up a professional website to promote your work! The course is designed for novices, and no preexisting familiarity with these tools and no programming background is assumed. See https://github.com/djnavarro/robust-tools for details.
