# what do they know so far?

- background knowledge per learner profiles
- familiarity with the "look" of rstudio
- opened a preexisting project in rstudio.cloud
- typed a few things, clicked on a few things

# structure...

1. "let's get started": basic logic of a ggplot

- describe: instructor "builds & narrates" a simple ggplot
- solidify: small groups discussion to reason about the code
- practice: 

2. "mapping data to aesthetics"

3. "building plots in layers"

4. "tidying our code": global vs local mappings

5. "paired exercises"

- this is really a consolidation only

6. "naming arguments"

7. 

... draw the rest of the owl: needs work :-)
